Explicitly indicates that a Connection field is a one-to-many relation and defines how the tables are joined.
A back-reference field can be specified indicating a field in the connection node type that refers back to the containing type.
For example, if type A has a connection field to nodes of type B and type B contains a field of type A called x,
the connection field in type A would specify `@oneToMany(backrefField: "x")`.
If more than one field is needed to specify the join, a back-reference join can be specified that lists pairs of fields
in each type that should be join. The first field in the pair is the one in the connection node type. If both fields have
the same name, a single string can be specified instead of a pair.
For example, if type C has a connection field to nodes of type D and needs to be joined where C.i = D.i and C.j = D.k,
the connection field in type C would specify `@oneToMany(backrefJoin: [["i"], ["k", "j"]])`.
Note that back-reference fields cannot have required/non-null arguments.
If no relation directive is used on a connection field, and the edge type contains no additional fields besides the node
and the cursor, the default behavior is to look for a single field in the connection node type of the type containing the
connection field with no required arguments. If such a field is found, it defines a one-to-many relation. Otherwise,
a many-to-many relation is used based on a new table with a name derived from the connection edge type.
